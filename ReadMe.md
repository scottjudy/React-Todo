# React-1 - Todo Project 

### What is React?
- Read this first: [Facebook Docs](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/hello-world.html)
- Learn about the [React Life Cycle Methods](https://engineering.musefind.com/react-lifecycle-methods-how-and-when-to-use-them-2111a1b692b1)

### Battle Plan
 - Objective: At this point you have become familiar with the DOM and have exausted research on the wonderful world of HTML and CSS. Now we're going to dive into modern JavaScript development by learning about ReactJS.
 - You're going to be building a ToDo App (please hold your applause).
 - We know this seems trivial, but the best part about this assignment is that is shows off some of the strengths of react and you can take it as far as want.

  - Tool suggesstions
    - React Dev Tools - * This is a MUST you need to install this asap!
    - For styling we'll be using [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/)
    - We have everything you need for your React Developer environment in this file. We went over this in the lecture video.

#### To Get Started
##### You'll need to make sure you have the following installed.
  - node and npm
  - webpack `npm instal -g webpack` to install it globally
  - `npm install` will pull in all the node_modules you need
  - `npm start` will start a development server on your localhost at port 8080.
